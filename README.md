# TIC-TAC-TOE GAME - Python3
Using Tkinter

My goal was to create a tic-tac-toe game for two players (X and O). The players take turns on a 3x3 grid and if a player
gets 3 marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. then the player wins. The game will result in a draw if 
no one gets 3 in a row and all the cells are selected.

- Game Components:
Game board built with a class called TicTacToeBoard.
Game logic managed using class called TicTacToeGame.
- Window Components:
'Top Display' shows info about game's status and 'Grid of cells' represents previous moves and available spaces or cells
- Game display was created using tkinter.Label widget
- tkinter.Button widgets were used to arrange gird of cells.
